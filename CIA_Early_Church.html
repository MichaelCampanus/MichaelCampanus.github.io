	<h1>Early Church Literature</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>The Point of all this Greeks-And-Romans Nonsense</h2>
	<p>We just spent about 18 months of your lives reading Greeks and Romans. I know <s>some</s> <s>most</s> all of you, at some point, have looked at 20 more pages of Livy and asked, "Why do I have to read this?"</p>
	<p>You'll start to get it soon, now that we're talking about Christian literature.</p>
	<p>Let's start with the Romans, since we've been on about them for a bit.</p>
	<h2>The Fullness of Time I</h2>
	<p>Back in the day, it was illegal to be a Christian in Rome. Several reasons. They thought we were cannibal, terrorist, orgy-having, child-and-wife-stealing, god-hating, atheist cultists from the middle east, to put it bluntly. To be fair, more than half of that was true.</p>
	<p>Anyway. They'd kill you if they caught you. And if they killed you, that made you a martyr.</p>
	<p>Being a martyr is</p>
	<center><em><small>[and I can't emphasize this enough]</small></em></center>
	<center><h3>A BIG DEAL</h3></center>
	<p>So big a deal, your friends back at church would make a whole chant, just about you, so they could remember you and your absolutely heroic devotion to Jesus. Then, they'd sing it on your martyrdom-anniversary.</p>
	<p>Eventually, they had a martyr for every day of the year. So they had a chant for every day of the year. "We can't add any more martyrs," even though there were a lot more.</p>
	<p>The final list of all the chants is called the "Roman Martyrology." Every day, you would do the little song about the person who got ripped apart by emus in the colosseum a few years back.</p>
	<p>Some days, though, the chant wasn't about a martyr. Some days, something more important than that was happening, and it felt weird to be singing about your dead church buddy. One of those days was Christmas.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haSzG09Q4OM">For Christmas, the chant from the martyrology went like this.</a></p>
	<p>Listen to it. The whole thing. Go on.</p>
	<p>Done? Did you catch it?</p>
	<center><h3>"The whole world being at peace."</h3></center>
	<p>That bit. Why? Why was the world at peace on the date of Jesus' birth? We know from Herodotus that the only way to describe the area Jesus was born in would be "CONSTANT WAR, EVERY DAY." What happened?</p>
	<p>Romans, kiddo. Romans happened. Buncha angry little war-hobbits from Italy. They rolled over the entire Mediterranean and told everyone to cut that war nonsense out.</p>
	<p>And everyone did. Romans were scary. So everyone listened.</p>
	<p>Under the very early Roman empire, there were no wars. No pirates. No bandits on the roads. You could hop on a boat, sail from Jerusalem to Athens, walk the rest of the way to Corinth, hop a boat, sail right to Rome. Nobody would murder you, and you wouldn't get robbed even once.</p>
	<p>Absolutely amazing. Nobody had ever thought of that before the Romans. Truly revolutionary.</p>
	<h2>The Fullness of Time II</h2>
	<p>Another thing. Remember the gods? The ones from Homer and Vergil? Those are some real characters, aren't they? Nasty little awful little people.<p>
	<p>By the time Jesus was born, you have to understand that nobody actually worshipped those guys.</p>
	<p>A peasant might have some local goddess he worshipped. Someone nobody outside his village had ever heard of.</p>
	<p>Soldiers and merchants had gotten involved in cults devoted to mysteries, like the Mithraic and Orphean mystery cults.</p>
	<p>The rich and educated followed the philosophers, deciding that there was only one all-powerful god. They just didn't know anything about him.</p>
	<p>This is the world as it was when Jesus was born.</p>
	<p>Pause.</p>
	<p>Think about that.</p>
	<p>This is what we call "the fullness of time."</p>
	<p>The exactly right moment.</p>
	<p>Christianity after Christ will have freedom to spread on open roads to people who are desperate for religion. It was perfect.</p>
	<p>It's not an accident. God prepared the world for the coming of Christ through the law and the prophets, of course. But you must not forget that he also prepared the world for the coming of Christ through the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks mentally and spiritually prepared the non-Jewish world. The Romans brought peace to it.</p>
	<p>With that in mind, it should not be surprising that the Greeks and Romans were the first people to really get it. To truly become Christians. They were ready for it.</p>
	<h2>What Happened After Jesus</h2>
	<p>Jesus shows up. Does His thing. Leaves. Holy Spirit shows up. Does His thing. Leaves.</p>
	<p>Now what?</p>
	<p>The Apostles were told they were to spread the gospel. They were to teach and baptize.</p>
	<p>But what do they teach? They couldn't teach the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Those books weren't written yet. Paul never read them, and every single one of his letters was written before anyone had ever seen a written gospel.</p>
	<p>Of course they told stories about Jesus. Very probably there was what we would call an "oral gospel." But in order to understand the next few months, you need to understand the MOST FUNDAMENTAL VERSION OF CHRISTIANITY.</p>
	<p>The core of it.</p>
	<p>It runs like this. These exact words, handed down to us over 2000 years:</p>
	<ol><li>I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:</li><li>And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord:</li><li>Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary:</li><li>Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead and buried: He descended into hell:</li><li>The third day he rose again from the dead:</li><li>He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty:</li><li>From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead:</li><li>I believe in the Holy Ghost:</li><li>I believe in the holy catholic church: the communion of saints:</li><li>The forgiveness of sins:</li><li>The resurrection of the body:</li><li>And the life everlasting.</li></ol>
	<p>You might recognize these words, but it wouldn't surprise me if this is the first time you see them. American Christians (for some odd reason) don't usually know them. Outside of the USA, almost every church-going man, woman, and child can rattle off those twelve bullet points without even thinking. It's been that way for 2000 years.</p>
	<p>You will notice there are twelve points. This is the teaching of the twelve apostles. They each contributed a point. This set of teachings is collectively called the <b>Apostles' Creed</b>
	<p>When the church spread, it mostly did so via these words. The four written Gospels eventually showed up, as well as the rest of the New Testament, but you have to understand that just because a book was written, doesn't mean you could get a copy. As a matter of fact, it was extremely unlikely that you ever heard or read any of the New Testament books for the first hundred years of Christianity. They were out there, but they were hard to get a hold of.<p>
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>So, we have Jesus. We have a religion. We have holy scriptures to support that religion.</p>
	<p>But we have a problem.</p>
	<p>See, for <b>YOU</b>, Christianity pretty much makes sense. You read the Bible and you get what it means.</p>
	<p>For <b>THEM</b>, however, NOTHING MADE SENSE.</p>
	<p>People don't fully grasp what I mean when I say that. Let me give you an example. It took about 200 years before someone (his name was Origen) first came up with a brilliant theory that maybe...</p>
	<p>... just maybe...</p>
	<p>... the snake in the Garden of Eden was Satan.</p>
	<p>It took about 250 years before someone (Tertullian) looked at scripture, squinted, and suggested that maybe God is three people.</p>
	<p>And, most importantly,</p>
	<p>MOST IMPORTANTLY,</p>
	<p><b>it took nearly 350 years before everyone was <em>pretty sure</em> that Jesus was God.</b> 450 before they were completely sure.</p>
	<p>God gave them all the information they needed to figure it out. But He did not do the work for them. And it was a lot of work. A lot of work and arguing that, today, we take for granted. Of course Jesus is God. Duh. Obviously.</p>
	<p>Not obvious for the early Christians. They had to theorize about it. They argued about it. It got so heated that Santa Claus himself got out of his chair, walked across a room, punched a man in the face and was about to ground-and-pound him before they locked him in his room for a couple weeks to cool off.</p>
	<p>So, these next few months, we're going to read a little taste of that.</p>
	<h2>Apostolic and Patristic Eras</h2>
	<p>The time when the apostles were around is called the Apostolic era. I don't need to explain why. But the time after the Apostles were all dead, and the time which we're about to be readint about, is called the Patristic era.</p>
	<p>It's called Patristic because that is when the Church Fathers lived.</p>
	<p>What are Church Fathers? They're the guys devoted to figuring it out. They're the ones pouring over the scriptures for centuries, trying to make sense of it. Trying to figure out who this Jesus guy was. Where he came from. What it meant for us.</p>
	<p>The Patristic Era can be divided into two halfs, based on who was writing at the time. The first half is when the Ante-Nicene Fathers wrote. The second half is when the Post-Nicene Fathers wrote.</p>
	<p>What does Nicene mean? You don't need to know that yet. For now, do your reading for the week. Enjoy it. It's good stuff.</p>
