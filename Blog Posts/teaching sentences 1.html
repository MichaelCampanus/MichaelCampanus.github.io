	<h2>Teaching Sentences, Part I</h2>
	<i>8/27/2023</i>
	<p><a href="meaning first.html">Here</a>, I mentioned teaching sentences before teaching grammar, in the pursuit of meaning. How do you actually do that?</p>

    <p>It's not hard. Let's say that this sentence means "the girl had a lamb."</p>
    
    <div class="blockquote">in tas lanin muuni</div>
    
    <p>Obviously, you don't know which word is which, because I made those words up just now. How about "the girl had a <strong>dog</strong>?"</p>

    <div class="blockquote">in <strong>sher</strong> lanin muuni</div>

    <p>Now "the <strong>boy</strong> had a dog."</p>
    
    <div class="blockquote">in sher <strong>gar</strong> muuni</div>

    <p>And, of course, "the boy had a lamb."</p>

    <div class="blockquote">in tas gar muuni</div>

    <p>
        What about "the lamb had a girl?"
    </p>
    
    <div class="blockquote">
        in lanin tas muuni
    </div>

    <p>
        "The dog had a boy?"
    </p>

    <div class="blockquote">in gar sher muuni</div>

    <p>Picking it up? If not, let the words sink in a little. Read it a few times. Say it aloud a bit. Chew on it. In a classroom, I'd have these boys and girls and their animals drawn on the board, so I could point to them as I gave sentences, but a little deduction will have to be enough over text.</p>

    <p>Making sense? Good. You've learned a sentence. The sentence is "a [subject] had an [object]."</p>

    <p>Now we can talk grammar. That word "in?" It goes before the direct object. The word after "in" is the object of the sentence.</p>

    <p>The vocabulary of the lesson:</p>
    <div class="blockquote">
    tas = lamb
    <br>
    sher = dog
    <br>
    lanin = girl
    <br>
    gar = boy
    <br>
    muuni = had
    <br>
    in = direct object marker</div>

    <p>Okay, let's put the conlang away. What did I do in that lesson?</p>

    <p>First, a sentence. I told you what it means. You had a message, but didn't understand why it meant what it did, or any of the parts.</p>

    <p>Then, we played with the sentence. You learned other, similar sentences, which developed into a narrowing, sharper understanding of the individual words. You had a sentence, and a little vocabulary.</p>

    <p>Then, you learned some grammar. Now, you understand not only the sentence, but also the parts.</p>

    <p>The sentence is basic. Meaning is basic. We want to build understanding of grammar and vocabulary on the back of sentences and meaning.</p>
