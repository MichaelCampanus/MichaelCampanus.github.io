	<h2>Hello World</h2>
	<i>8/20/2023</i>
	<p>Howdy, folks.</p>
	<p>I'm a private tutor; I don't work for a school. Louisiana schools are some of the worst in the nation, so a lot of educated parents homeschool their kids, here. That's most of my students, that.</p>
	<p>I mostly teach Latin. I have no paper qualifications to do this. I've never taken a formal Latin class, and have no relevant degrees. I learned from an insurance salesman who never attended a university. I speak well enough and read quickly and easily. Been studying Latin for twenty years and speaking it for ten.</p>
	<p>If I say things about teaching Latin that sound odd or impractical, chalk it up to the above. I have no administrators or oversight, I have complete control over how I teach, and being untrained, everything I do in the classroom I either figured out by trial and error, or stole from someone else.</p>
	<p>There're ups and downs to that. The freedom means I can really experiment and focus on getting the language into students' minds and tongues. It also means a lot of what I do won't cross over into a traditional classroom so easily. I've never issued a grade in my Latin classes, and frankly don't plan to start anytime soon.</p>
	<p>Take what you find here as you find it. If I'm wrong about something, please let me know. I'm often wrong. If my Latin is less than perfect, send me a correction. I and my students will appreciate you. Hopefully, you find something useful, or at least get a laugh out of the hedge-teacher's rudimentary pedagogy.</p>
