        <h1>Introduction to Alliterative Verse</h1>
        <p>Alliterative verse is a form of English poetry that was used to write <em>Beowulf</em> and other Old English poems, but was almost totally abandoned after Chaucer. In my opinion, it's easier to write than rhyming poetry, and has the lure of being ancient.</p>
        <p>Lines of English poetry have a beat. Consider <i>Hickory, Dickory, Dock:</i></p>
        <div class="blockquote">
        Hickory, dickory, dock,
        <br>
        The mouse ran up the clock;
        <br>
        The clock struck one,
        <br>
        And down he run,
        <br>
        Hickory, dickory, dock.
        </div>
        <p>The first, second, and final line have three beats. The third and fourth lines have two beats. The simplest English poems count the beats in a line, and nothing else. More advanced metrical poems may also count syllables, or expect the beats and syllables to be arranged in particular patterns, like Shakespeare's iambic pentameter.</p>
        <p>Alliterative verse is a relatively simple form, so we'll only be worried about the beats in a line. Each line should have four beats, just like <i>Star Light, Star Bright:</i></p>
        <div class="blockquote">
        <u>Star</u> <u>light</u>, <u>star</u> <u>bright</u>,
        <br>
        <u>First</u> <u>star</u> I <u>see</u> to<u>night</u>,
        <br>
        I <u>wish</u> I <u>may</u>, I <u>wish</u> I <u>might</u>
        <br>
        <u>Have</u> the <u>wish</u> I <u>wish</u> to<u>night.</u>
        </div>
        <p>Every four-beat line can be divided into two half-lines with two beats each. When we write alliterative verse, we build the poem out of two-beat half-lines, stiching them together to make full lines, and lines together to make poems. For instance, we could combine the half-line <i>Johnny was walking</i> with the half-line <i>down by the bayou</i> to make a full, four-beat line:</p> 
        <div class="blockquote">
        Johnny was walking | down by the bayou.
        </div>
        <p>That's how we make our lines. Now to decorate them. Alliterative verse doesn't rhyme; the main decoration comes from the alliteration.</p>
        <p>Alliteration is when the primary beats of two words start with the same sound. A few words that alliterate on the "M" sound: <i>mouse, maker, massive, mumble</i>. It's tempting to think of alliteration as happening when words <i>start</i> with the same letter, but that's not it. Take the word <i>amazing</i>. The emphasis is on the second syllable, which starts with "M," not the first one that starts with "A," so <i>amazing</i> alliterates with the other "M" words: "A massive amazing mumbling mouse meddles with medic's murmuring mango." Hear how <i>amazing</i> fits right in with the other words? That's alliteration.</p>
        <p>So, now we have a basic line, four beats, and a basic decoration, alliteration. How do we combine them?</p>
        <p>To write alliterative verse, at least one of the beats in the first half-line must alliterate with one of the beats in the second half-line. Taking the "mumbling mouse" example, we could arrange it like this into two lines of poetry:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
            A massive, amazing | mumbling mouse
            <br>
            meddles with medic's | murmuring mango.
        </div>
        <p>In that example, all four beats in each line alliterate on the "M" sound. It's a neat sound, but if every single beat of every line alliterates, it starts to sound obnoxious. Let's tone it down a little:</p>
         <div class="blockquote">
            A massive, terrible | mumbling rat
            <br>
            meddles with doctor's | murmuring apple.
        </div>
        <p>Better! Ancient alliterative verse almost never alliterates on the last syllable of the line, so we changed those words. And two alliterating beats per line is enough, even through a lot of lines do have three.</p>
        <p>Of course, both lines are still alliterating on the same sound. Ideally, you want to change it up from line to line. Let's try this:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
            A massive, terrible | mumbling rat
            <br>
            bites the doctor's | bitter apple.
        </div>
        <p>There we go. Now each line is alliterative, but on a different sound. That's the basic form of alliterative verse. It's easy and fun to write. Go give it a shot!</p>
