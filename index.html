<p><i>Salve!</i> I'm a private tutor. I teach almost anything I can understand, but most of my students are learning Latin with me. <i>The Silmarillion</i> is my comfort read, and I get a kick out of early modern poetry.</p>
<p>I'm currently building this site and experimenting with things. It's a work in progress. Bear with me.</p>
