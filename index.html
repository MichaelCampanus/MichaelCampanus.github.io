<h2>About</h2>
<p><i>Salve!</i> I'm a private tutor. I teach almost anything I can understand, but most of my students are learning Latin with me. <i>The Silmarillion</i> is my comfort read, and I get a kick out of early modern poetry. You'll find here <a href="latin resources.html">resources for Latin students</a>, <a href="learn latin.html">online classes</a>, and other <a href="bits and bobs.html">bits and bobs</a>.
