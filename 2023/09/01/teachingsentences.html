<h2>How to Teach a Sentence</h2>
<i>9/1/2023</i>

<p>If you're going to teach a sentence, you have to abstract it a little. <i>Maria parvum agnum habuit</i> is a great sentence, but you'd be hard pressed to build a whole lesson on that one line Instead, you want to think of the sentence you're teaching more in terms of its form. The form here is [subject] [adjective] [object] [verbed].</p>

<p>To teach that sentence, you're gonna have to repeat it a lot. How you do that is up to you. I've seen different methods; I like storytelling, myself. Regardless of <i>how,</i> though, you'll need different variations on that sentence.</p>

<p>You can vary it a lot of ways. Here's a few:
<div class=blockquote>
Maria parvum canem habuit.<br>
Marcus parvum agnum non habuit.<br>
</div>

<p>Let's do this sentence as a story.</p>

<div class=blockquote>
Columbus navem non habuit.<br>
Columbus pecuniam non habuit.<br>
Isabella pecuniam habuit.<br>
Isabella magnam pecuniam habuit.<br>
Isabella pecuniam dedit.<br>
Columbus pecuniam habuit!<br>
Columbus novam navem habuit.<br>
</div>

<p>And so on. Note how you can change any part of the sentence and retain the basic structure. Gives your sentence room to breath. I went for minimal verb changes, but you can swap out any part of the sentence.</p>

<p>You can use variations to teach specific concepts, if you like. Suppose you want to teach some tense variations.</p>

<div class=blockquote>
Marcus agnum habuit, sed Marcus agnum non habet. Marcus agnum Mariae dedit.<br>
Maria non habuit agnum, sed Maria agnum <i>habet</i>. Marcus agnum ei dedit!
</div>

<p>You can squeeze a lot out of just that one sentence. It's got a subject, which can be singular or plural, and any of five declensions, as well as an object and adjective with the same possible variations, plus the possibility of cross-declension case agreement. It has a verb with a tense and an aspect and a person, any of which could be targeted for the lesson. You could teach a significant chunk of the Latin language just by varying that one sentence.</p>
